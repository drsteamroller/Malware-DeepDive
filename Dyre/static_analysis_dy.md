# Dyre: Static Analysis

## 1. TrIDNET & Detect it Easy

This time around I won't post the pictures because most of these are probably going to be PE files. After unzipping the archive, 8 files popped out. Some of them have names like fax_..., loader_..., and payload_... so I'll analyze files other than those. The top file alphabetically is also the largest, so I'll just start there. 

Throwing it into TrIDNET & DiE, they both say that it is unabashedly a PE file.

Its entropy is very high, which means its most likely been packed. Luckily we can retrieve the actual executable file from memory dumping. With OllyDbg and OllyDump I dumped out from the entry point of the original file and saved it as Dyre_dump.exe. It now shows the .txt section as not packed, but the .rsrc section now reads as packed. I'll see if I did it correctly when I move to Ghidra. I also dumped it using Scylla, which didn't seem to change anything.
