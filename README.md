# Malware-DeepDive
A repo to store my findings on static/dynamic analyses of malware samples.

## File Structure

The folders will be the name of the malware being analyzed, and inside the folders there will be files on static & dynamic analysis of the malware, as well as some debugging- if the malware permits.

I'm also including my final project from my Cyber Security Engineering class at George Mason University where I did a thorough analysis of 2 malware samples.
