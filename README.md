# Malware-DeepDive
A repo to store my findings on static/dynamic analyses of malware samples.

## File Structure

The folders will be the name of the malware being analyzed, and inside the folders there will be files on static & dynamic analysis of the malware, as well as some debugging- if the malware permits. All samples were obtained from theZoo (https://github.com/ytisf/theZoo) unless otherwise stated. I will not be doing any research into the samples, and I'll be looking into them completely blind, the only exceptions being ones that I've researched (but not reversed) previously.

I'm also including my final project from my Reverse Engineering class at George Mason University where I did a thorough analysis of 2 malware samples.
